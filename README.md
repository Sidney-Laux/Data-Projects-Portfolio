# Data-Projects-Portfolio
My Data Analysis portfolio, containing projects using SQL, Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, and Power BI. 

## Data Query: SQL/ MySQL Workbench
I am able to use SQL to query data, create tables, alter tables, subquery, CTE, Join, aggregate, etc. To view my scripts, please see the SQL folder in this repository.
I use the publicly available Classic Models dataset in these scripts. 

## Data Prep: Google Sheets/ Excel
I learnt to use both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets to prepare data, from data entry to data cleanup, and organizing data into different sheets/tables with common columns for future JOIN cases.

## Data Visualization: Power BI & Tableau
I have created data visualization charts and dashboard using both Power BI and Tableau.
For Power BI, please see the Power BI folder in this repository.
For Tableau, please see my Tableau Public Vizzes here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/siti.asnawiah.binte.zaidi/vizzes
