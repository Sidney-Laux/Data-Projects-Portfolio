## Excel / Google Sheet for Data Cleanup and Pivot Table

For this I use a publicly available Netflix Titles dataset. The raw dataset is "Netflix Titles_Not Cleaned.csv".
I clean the data using Google Sheets; splitting text to columns to seperate Director and Cast's invidual names, filling in empty cells, seperate data into different sheets, with one common column for future joins.
The cleaned tables are also uploaded in the Cleaned Netflix Data folder.
I later use this data to make dashboards in Power BI.

## Google Sheet Data Visualization

I have used Google Sheets for Data Visualization of the Classic Models data using VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables, Sorts & Filters, and generate Charts.
